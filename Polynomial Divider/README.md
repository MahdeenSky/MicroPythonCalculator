# Polynomial Synthetic Divider

created for my fx_cg50 Calculator

Example of a Polynomial Expression: 1, 6, 9

Use:
	Enter the terms when asked
	then when entering the terms, enter x to stop entering the 
	polynomial to be divided.

Output:
	+ a list of values like [1, 6, 9] represents x^2 + 6x + 9 
	  in order of descending x powers
	+ the number of remainders

Example:
~ Parts insider # # are not part of the code ~
	Enter term 1: 1
	Enter term 2: 6
	Enter term 3: 9
	Enter term 4: x 
	# means x^2 + 6x + 9 #
	[1, 6, 9]
	(ax + b)
	Enter a: 1
	Enter b: 3 
	# means divide by (x + 3) #
	
	-Output-
	['1', '6', '9'] / [1, 3] =
	# means (x^2 + 6x + 9)/(x + 3) #
	[1.0, 3.0] remainder [0.0] 
	# means (x+3) is the quotient #

The Program is not designed to be foolproof so please give it the values it requires.
