# Polynomial Synthetic Divider

created for my fx_cg50 Calculator

Example of a Polynomial Expression: 1, 6, 9

Use:
	Enter the terms when asked
	then when entering the terms, enter x to stop entering the 
	polynomial to be divided.

Output:
	+ a list of values like [1, 6, 9] represents x^2 + 6x + 9
	  in order of descending x powers
	+ the number of remainders

Example:
