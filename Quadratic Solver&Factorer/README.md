# QuadraticSolver&Factorer

created for my Calculator

Example of a Quadratic Expression: Ax^2 + Bx + C

Use:
	Enter the values A, B, & C when asked

Output:
	A Factored Form if available &
	The Solutions/Roots

Example:
	Enter A: 1
	Enter B: 6
	Enter C: 9
	
	-Output-
	(1x+3)(1x+3)
	x1 = -3 # one solution as it is a perfect square

The Program is not designed to be foolproof so please give it the values it requires.

Now supports complete the square, but prone to errors
if you have any fix for my code find me on reddit @MahdeenSky
