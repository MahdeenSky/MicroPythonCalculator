# Sequence & Series Solver

The Sequences & Series involved are Arithmetic and Geometric.
stores and allows you to calculate using these given formulas
and import fractions into micropython

Support for micropython!

	Arithmetic:
1) An = a1 + (n-1)d
2) Sn = n/2 x (2a1 + (n-1)d)

	Geometric:
3) An = a1(r)^(n-1)
4) Sn = (a(1-(r)^n)/(1-r)
5) S_infinity = a/(1-r)

	Coming soon:
6) Recursive Sequences/Series

Use:

When you run the program, it'll ask you to enter
a for arithmetic or b for geometric

then it'll ask you the same thing but for either the nth term, sum of the first nth terms, or sum of infinity

Used for IGCSEs/A Levels/SAT.
