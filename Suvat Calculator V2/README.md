# Suvat Calculator V2

Suvat stands for kinematics or

(s)displacement
(u)initial velocity
(v)final velocity
(a)acceleration
(t)time

This calculator can find the remaining 2 variables given 3 other variables!
Enter x on the variables which are unknown

Ex:

	Distance: 20
	Initialvelocity: 0
	final velocity: 10
	acceleration: x
	time: x
	
	-Output-
	Acceleration = 2.5
	Time = 4.0

Works with all equations like

1) s = ut + (1/2)at^2
2) v^2 = u^2 + 2as
3) s = vt - (1/2)at^2
4) s = (1/2)(u+v)t
5) v = u + at

If any of you has a fx-cg50 casio calculator
then update its os, as its latest version contains micropython,
me personally i used this module in my a level edexcel exams.

Used for IGCSEs/A Levels/SAT.
